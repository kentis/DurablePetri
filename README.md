petriCode
=========

PetriCode is a tool to generate code from CPN models annotated with pragmatics. 
PetriCode allows the user to define code generation pragmatics and templates.
PetriCode is not meant to be a full general purpose graphical programming language, 
rather a platform for making domain specific languages. Also, in recognition of the fact 
that no modeling-level language can ever be complete we provide the user with endless 
opportunities to extend pragmatics and templates to fit individual projects.
